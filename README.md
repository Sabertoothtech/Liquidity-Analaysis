## Quantifying impact of a News on the volume of the Equity:
    It is very obvious that a News about a company positive or negative will affect the company's stock in some manner.
    
    The price can rise-up or fall-down, even stay about the same at times. We can determine the sentiment of the news by the change in price, as to check wether the news was positive or negative.
    
    But to measure the impact a news carry we should use volume as one of the factor. Volume of a stock is very volatile, and thus, it is difficult to analyse the impact by simply calculating percentage change in the volume itself. Believe me when I say that I have observed more than 400% change in volume within some interval of time.
