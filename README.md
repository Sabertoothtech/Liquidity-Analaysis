### News impact analysis using volume:
   We can determine the sentiment of the news by the change in price, as to check wether the news was positive or negative. But to measure the impact a news carry we should use volume as one of the factor. Volume of a stock is very volatile, and thus, it is difficult to analyse the impact by simply calculating percentage change in the volume itself. [Here](https://github.com/Sabertoothtech/Liquidity-Analaysis/blob/master/News%20Impact%20(%20Volume%20Analysis).ipynb) is an approach to study the impact news carry by using the volume data before and after the news, and simple statistical factors like mean and standard deviation.
